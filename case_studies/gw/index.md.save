# BerkeleyGW Case Study Overview

## Description of Code

BerkeleyGW is material science application that computes the excited-state properties of materials including moleculues, 
nanostrutures, cystals as well as complex systems with defects and interfaces. It is often used in conjunction with Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
applications like Quantum ESPRESSO, SIESTA, Abinit etc. which accurately calculate ground-state properties of materials - properties where all the electrons 
are in their lowest energy configuration.
