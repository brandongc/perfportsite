- GCC
  - "teams" on CPU - thread pooling problem
  - 7.1 linking error with -foffload=nvptx-none
    - full Fortran "target" -foffload support will come in 7.2
    - only partially supported in 7.1
    - wait for Thorsten before writing this down
  - would be nice if it was more verbose during compilation
    - IBM tells you exactly when it's generating PTX code
    - GCC is usually mum

- Intel
  - by default, wants to offload to KNC
    - does not work on KNL
    - requires some device library to "offload" to KNL
    - maybe an Intel bug? or a Cray bug?

- Cray
  - 8.5.7 compiler on Titan segfaults while compiling on our code
